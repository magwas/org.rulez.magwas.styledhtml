This is the structured report style.

The report contains the objects and diagrams in the same structure as they are in the model, ith a table of contents.

If you want to hide something from the report, use the report:hide property on it with a value which evaluates to true (1 is okay).
If you hide a folder, it hides the contents of it.

The output might not be nice, but at least easy to overview.
Cosmetic fixups are welcome, I am not good at visual design.
