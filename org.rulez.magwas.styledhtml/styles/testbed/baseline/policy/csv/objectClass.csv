5834034d;abstractNamed;;72b37366 c496f50f 80c1003b;The primary abstraction of the policy is the objectClass element.An objectClass describes a concept derived from either a builtin archimate element, or another objectClass: the ancestor of the objectClass.We can define the objectClass of an archimate element in one of the following ways:- add a property where the name is "objectClass" and the value is the name of the objectclass- add a property where the name is in the form &lt;class&gt;:&lt;property&gt;, where &lt;class&gt; is the name of the objectclass, and &lt;property&gt; is the name of one of the properties of the objectclass. The value vill be the value of the objectClass property.- create a Group in a view, with the property named "associatedObjectClass". The value of the property should be the name of the objectClass. All the elements within the group (including the nested ones) will belong to the objectClassThe policy related to the objectclass will help to check the model for structure and content, and also makes creating reports and generating configurations easier.One of the examples of this is that the policy for this model can be generated from this model, and the generated policy can be used to check that this model is indeed conforms to the policy which is generated from it :);objectClass;
